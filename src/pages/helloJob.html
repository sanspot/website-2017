      <p>
        Hellojob is a online service that that puts people in contact with specialised workers (e.g. cleaners, electricians). After an initial conversation with the founder, I decided to help him tackle some big assumptions I thought he was making, and help him see his product beyond what he’d already built.
I decided to focus on three things:

          We conducted <strong>one-on-one interviews</strong> with people from different customer segments to uncover their fears and habits when it comes to banking.

          <br />
          We also interviewed the branches’ staff to understand how their interactions could impact the migration of the customers to digital channels.

        <h1 class="">A stickier, more effective onboarding experience</h1>
        <p>
          Onboarding can make the difference between digital dropouts and regular users. An effective onboarding experience can prevent people dropping out of digital usage because of a confusing first use. It can also be used to re-engage customers who have stopped using digital after bad earlier experiences.

    <div class="columns small-12 medium-expand">
      <h2>Lead the customer</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of jumping into a tour we wanted to lead the customers into the onboarding. On a first login a modal would be shown with a list of things the customer can achieve on their online account. <br> Because users are more likely to complete a list if one or more elements are checked, the passcode creation, which the user sets up on signup, was the first element in the list to be marked as done.
      </p>
      <h2>Do what’s important first</h2>
      <p>
        10% of the customer base goes in branch to check balances. Why not start from there? Adress main customer painpoints upfront in the onboarding.

        <h2>Teach by doing</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of showing customers features through static screens, onboarding should get the customer to use the actual interfaces as much as possible. This is beacuse people are more likely to remember something if they have done it already. This is why we used interactive tooltips throughout the onboarding flow, prompting the customer to perform different tasks along the way.

      <h1>A frictionless security check</h1>
      <p>
        Registration, login and security-code generators usage are the highest friction points of the customer experience, putting customers off digital channels.
        We started testing alternate, more usable security processes than the one currently used by the bank to find the balance between security and convenience.
      </p>
      <h2>Using CVV and security questions for verification </h2>
      <p>
        Giving their CVV is familiar to many customers from online shopping. Security questions feel secure to customers and are more convenient than using automated code generators.

      <h1>Cross-channel communications</h1>
      <p>
        We started thinking about how we could use existing communication channels to nudge customers towards digital. We designed modular emails, so different nudges and calls to action could be swapped in and out to see what is most effective for each customer.
      </p>
      <h2>Redirect offline customers</h2>
      <p>
        One of the ideas we tested was to send customers a digital confirmation of offline  banking activities. The goal was to show the customer that online banking can do for them what they normally do offline.
      </p>
      <h2>A personal touch</h2>
      <p>
        Looking at our research we realised that one of the things that really makes people go back to branches is the interaction with local staff. One of the modules we designed prompted the customer to book an appointment with one of the staff of the branch the customer goes to. Again our purpose was to use digital channels to bridge the gap between the offline and online experience.
